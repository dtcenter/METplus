Build Components README file
============================

Basic Description
-----------------
The files in this directory are used to grab all of the METplus components including MET and then build MET.

Compents are cloned from a github repository using manage_externals and are specified in the Externals.cfg file.

MET external libraries are grabbed from dtcenter.org.

All of this is controlled via the build_MET.sh file
