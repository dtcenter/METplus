These files are a use case to show how to compute meridial and zonal means

You need METcalcpy and METdataio in your python path or your conda environment
i.e.
export PYTHONPATH=<path>/METdataio:<path>/METcalcpy

The file SSWC_v1.0_varFull_ERAi_d20130106_s20121107_e20130307_c20160701.nc needs to be
on disk somewhere on your computer and referenced correctly in the file
meridial_mean.yaml
