# GridStat METplus Configuration for the glotec_vs_glotec space weather use case: 
#    GloTEC initialized with and without COSMIC-1 RO data (id: vx7)
#
# Author: Jonathan Vigh (NCAR/RAL/JNTP)
#
# Description: This use case illustrates the use of grid_stat tool for the space weather domain.
#              It compares Total Electron Content for a GloTEC model run initialized with COSMIC-1
#              radio occultation (RO) data to a GloTEC model run without such data. 
#
#              In this use case, the forecast is considered to be the run without COSMIC-1 RO data.
#              The observations are considered to be the run with COSMIC-1 RO data.
#
#              This use case runs grid_stat for all of the forecast times for one day for a 
#              space weather event known as the St. Patricks Day Storm (Mar 17, 2015). 
#
#              Novel aspects of this use case:
#                - First example use case to run grid_stat on a space weather model (GloTEC)
#                - Example of how to run with NetCDF input data which do not strictly conform to the 
#                      Climate Forecasts (CF) conventions
#                - Example of using masks covering latitudinal bands of interest to the space weather community:
#                      equatorial region, mid-latitude region, and polar region
#                - Example of masking using the value of a quality flag at each time step and grid point
#
