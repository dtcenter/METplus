The **defaults.conf** contains default METplus configurations that are read first when
METplus is run. These values can be changed directly to change the default behavior.
This is typically done when installing the wrappers on a new machine to set the
values for **MET_INSTALL_DIR** and **INPUT_BASE** to the appropriate location on disk.
The values can also be overridden in any METplus configuration file that is passed to
run_metplus.py.
