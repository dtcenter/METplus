EMC-NCEP-NOAA produtil library utility package    {#METplus_produtil}
==============================================


The produtil directory is a Platform-independent weather and ocean forecasting
utility package. Developed at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

+ @ref produtil_overview "Package \"produtil\"" --- The produtil Python package creates a
platform-independent environment for running METplus.  This
package is independent of the METplus system and can be used for other
numerical weather and ocean prediction systems.  It implements
critical functionality missing from the Python 2.6 standard library.
There are many alternatives to standard library functions and classes,
which provide bug fixes to bugs in Python, adds logging and error
checking, and provides workarounds for known problems on some
platforms.

+ @ref produtil.config --- Parses UNIX conf files and makes the result readily available.
This is part of the produtil package and is referenced here as a convenience.
