##@namespace command_runner
# The purpose of this class is to run the external MET executables
# and other ancillary external programs used in METplus, such as
# wgrib2, ncdump, plot_tcmpr.R
#
# It also centralizes the output redirection to the
# METplus logs, MET logs or TTY.
#
# One BIG underlying assumption is that all commands are run
# the same way in terms of the Runner object and the Run command
# executed.
#
# Originally this capability (the methods) was placed in the
# CommandBuilder but it seemed to separating out made sense.
# CommandBuilder now has-a CommandRunner. But being in its own class
# allows it to be used elsewhere if needed.
#
# It creates a produtil Runnable object
# It determines where to redirect the output
#   METplus log file, MET logs, or TTY
# It runs the Runnable object
