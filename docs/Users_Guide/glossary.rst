   FCST_PCP_COMBINE_INPUT_ACCUMS
     Specify what accumulation levels should be used from the forecast data for the analysis. This is a list of input accumulations in the order of preference to use to build the desired accumulation. If an accumulation cannot be used (i.e. it is larger than the remaining accumulation that needs to be built) then the next value in the list is tried. Units are assumed to be hours unless a time identifier such as Y, m, d, H, M, S is specifed at the end of the value, i.e. 30M or 1m.

     If the name and/or level of the accumulation value must be specified for the data, then a list of equal length to this variable must be set for FCST_PCP_COMBINE_INPUT_NAMES and FCST_PCP_COMBINE_INPUT_LEVELS. See this sections for more information.

     This variable can be set to {lead} if the accumulation found in a given file corresponds to the forecast lead of the data. If this is the case, FCST_PCP_COMBINE_BUCKET_INTERVAL can be used to reset the accumulation at a given interval.

     A corresponding variable exists for observation data called OBS_PCP_COMBINE_INPUT_ACCUMS.

     Examples:

     1H, 30M

     This will attempt to use a 1 hour accumulation, then try to use a 30 minute accumulation if the first value did not succeed.

   FCST_PCP_COMBINE_BUCKET_INTERVAL
     Used when FCST_PCP_COMBINE_INPUT_ACCUMS contains {lead} in the list. This is the interval to reset the bucket accumulation. For example, if the accumulation is reset every 3 hours (forecast 1 hour has 1 hour accum, forecast 2 hour has 2 hour accum, forecast 3 hour has 3 hour accum, forecast 4 hour has 1 hour accum, etc.) then this should be set to 3 or 3H.

     FCST_PCP_COMBINE_INPUT_ACCUMS = 6, 1
     FCST_PCP_COMBINE_INPUT_NAMES = P06M_NONE, P01M_NONE

     This says that the 6 hour accumulation field name is P06M_NONE and the 1 hour accumulation field name is P01M_NONE.
