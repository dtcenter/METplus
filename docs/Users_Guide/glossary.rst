   REGRID_DATA_PLANE_ONCE_PER_FIELD
     If True, run RegridDataPlane separately for each field name/level combination specified in the configuration file. See  :ref:`Field_Info` for more information on how fields are specified. If False, run RegridDataPlane once with all of the fields specified.

   CUSTOM_LOOP_LIST
     List of strings that are used to run each item in the :term:`PROCESS_LIST` multiple times for each run time to allow the tool to be run with different configurations. The filename template tag {custom?fmt=%s} can be used throughout the METplus configuration file. For example, the text can be used to supply different configuration files (if the MET tool uses them) and output filenames/directories. If you have two configuration files, SeriesAnalysisConfig_one and SeriesAnalysisConfig_two, you can set::

       [config]
       CUSTOM_LOOP_LIST = one, two
       SERIES_ANALYSIS_CONFIG_FILE = {CONFIG_DIR}/SeriesAnalysisConfig_{custom?fmt=%s}

       [dir]
       SERIES_ANALYSIS_OUTPUT_DIR = {OUTPUT_BASE}/{custom?fmt=%s}

     With this configuration, SeriesAnalysis will be called twice. The first run will use SeriesAnalysisConfig_one and write output to {OUTPUT_BASE}/one. The second run will use SeriesAnalysisConfig_two and write output to {OUTPUT_BASE}/two.

     If unset or left blank, the wrapper will run once per run time. There are also wrapper-specific configuration variables to define a custom string loop list for a single wrapper, i.e. :term:`SERIES_ANALYSIS_CUSTOM_LOOP_LIST` and :term:`PCP_COMBINE_CUSTOM_LOOP_LIST`.

     This value can be set to a call to a python script with arguments to supply data to the MET tools via Python Embedding. Filename template syntax can be used here to specify time information of an input file, i.e. {valid?fmt=%Y%m%d%H}. See the `MET User's Guide <https://dtcenter.org/community-code/model-evaluation-tools-met/documentation>`_ for more information about Python Embedding in the MET tools.

   FCST_VAR<n>_OPTIONS
     Define the options for the <n>th forecast variable to be used in the analysis where <n> is an integer >= 1. These addition options will be applied to every name/level/threshold combination for VAR<n>. There can be <n> number of these variables defined in configuration files, simply increment the VAR1  string to match the total number of variables being used, e.g.:

     | FCST_VAR1_OPTIONS
     | FCST_VAR2_OPTIONS

   FCST_VAR<n>_THRESH
     Define the threshold(s) for the <n>th forecast variable to be used in the analysis where <n> is an integer >= 1. The value can be a single item or a comma separated list of items that must start with a comparison operator (>,>=,==,!=,<,<=,gt,ge,eq,ne,lt,le). If :term:`FCST_VAR<n>_THRESH` is not set but :term:`OBS_VAR<n>_THRESH` is, the same information will be used for both variables. There can be <n> number of these variables defined in configuration files, simply increment the VAR1 string to match the total number of variables being used, e.g.:

     If :term:`FCST_VAR<n>_THRESH` is set, then :term:`OBS_VAR<n>_THRESH` must be set as well. If the same value applies to both forecast and observation data, use :term:`BOTH_VAR<n>_THRESH`.

   OBS_VAR<n>_LEVELS
     Define the levels for the <n>th observation variable to be used in the analysis where <n> is an integer >= 1. The value can be a single item or a comma separated list of items. You can define NetCDF levels, such as (0,*,*), but you will need to surround these values with quotation marks so that the commas in the item are not interpreted as an item delimeter. Some examples:

     | OBS_VAR1_LEVELS = A06, P500

The value can be a single item or a comma separated list of items that must start with a comparison operator (>,>=,==,!=,<,<=,gt,ge,eq,ne,lt,le). If :term:`OBS_VAR<n>_THRESH` is not set but :term:`FCST_VAR<n>_THRESH` is, the same information will be used for both variables.

   FCST_PCP_COMBINE_INPUT_ACCUMS
     Specify what accumulation levels should be used from the forecast data for the analysis. This is a list of input accumulations in the order of preference to use to build the desired accumulation. If an accumulation cannot be used (i.e. it is larger than the remaining accumulation that needs to be built) then the next value in the list is tried. Units are assumed to be hours unless a time identifier such as Y, m, d, H, M, S is specifed at the end of the value, i.e. 30M or 1m.

     If the name and/or level of the accumulation value must be specified for the data, then a list of equal length to this variable must be set for :term:`FCST_PCP_COMBINE_INPUT_NAMES` and :term:`FCST_PCP_COMBINE_INPUT_LEVELS`. See this sections for more information.

     This variable can be set to {lead} if the accumulation found in a given file corresponds to the forecast lead of the data. If this is the case, :term:`FCST_PCP_COMBINE_BUCKET_INTERVAL` can be used to reset the accumulation at a given interval.

     A corresponding variable exists for observation data called :term:`OBS_PCP_COMBINE_INPUT_ACCUMS`.

     Examples:

     1H, 30M

     This will attempt to use a 1 hour accumulation, then try to use a 30 minute accumulation if the first value did not succeed.

For example, if the accumulation is reset every 3 hours (forecast 1 hour has 1 hour accum, forecast 2 hour has 2 hour accum, forecast 3 hour has 3 hour accum, forecast 4 hour has 1 hour accum, etc.) then this should be set to 3 or 3H.

     | FCST_PCP_COMBINE_INPUT_ACCUMS = 6, 1
     | FCST_PCP_COMBINE_INPUT_NAMES = P06M_NONE, P01M_NONE

     This says that the 6 hour accumulation field name is P06M_NONE and the 1 hour accumulation field name is P01M_NONE.

   USER_SCRIPT_INPUT_DIR
     Optional directory to look for input files. Prepended to each input
     template (see :term:`USER_SCRIPT_INPUT_TEMPLATE`).

     | *Used by:*  UserScript

   USER_SCRIPT_INPUT_TEMPLATE
     Optional list of input templates to use to look for input files.
     If :term:`USER_SCRIPT_INPUT_DIR` is set, prepend that path to each item.
     When the UserScript wrapper is run, the templates defined here will be
     used to populate a list of all of the files that match the template for
     each run time specified. Depending on the runtime frequency defined in
     :term:`USER_SCRIPT_RUNTIME_FREQ`, text files will be generated that
     contain a list of the file paths that correspond to the current run.
     If any files are not found on disk, then "missing" will be added in place
     of the file path. Each file list text file will be named after the current
     init/valid/lead values for that run and a label named input<n> where <n>
     is a zero-based index of the template, i.e. a single template will be
     labelled input0, two templates will be labelled input0 and input1, etc.
     Custom labels can be defined with
     :term:`USER_SCRIPT_INPUT_TEMPLATE_LABELS`. For each template, an
     environment variable named METPLUS_FILELIST_<label> will be set to the
     path of the appropriate file list text file. This environment variable
     can be referenced by the user-defined script to obtain the file list.

     | *Used by:*  UserScript

   USER_SCRIPT_INPUT_TEMPLATE_LABELS
     Optional list of labels that correspond to each input template defined.
     See :term:`USER_SCRIPT_INPUT_TEMPLATE`. Each template that does not have
     a label defined will be assigned a label with the format input<n> where
     <n> is the zero-based index of the template in the list.

   TC_PAIRS_RUN_ONCE
     If True, TCPairs will be run once using the
     INIT_BEG or VALID_BEG value (depending on the value of LOOP_BY).
     This is the default setting and preserves the original logic of the
     wrapper. If this variable is set to False, then TCPairs will run once
     for each run time iteration. The preferred configuration settings to
     run TCPairs once for a range of init or valid times is to set INIT_BEG
     to INIT_END (if LOOP_BY = INIT) and define the range of init times to
     filter the data inside TCPairs with TC_PAIRS_INIT_BEG and
     TC_PAIRS_INIT_END. The same applies for the VALID variables if
     LOOP_BY = VALID.

   GFDL_TRACKER_OUTPUT_DIR
     Directory to write output data created by GFDLTracker. The tracker
     application must be run from the directory containing all of the data and
     configuration files used, so the wrapper will call the application from
     this directory. Symbolic links for each input file including the TCVitals
     file will be created in this directory and removed after a successful run.
     The fort.X files required to run the tracker will be generated in
     this directory. Also, the input.nml file that is generated from the
     template NML file (specified by :term:`GFDL_TRACKER_NML_TEMPLATE_FILE`)
