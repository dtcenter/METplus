**Foreword: A note to METplus Wrappers users**


This User's Guide is provided as an aid to users of the Model Evaluation
Tools (MET) and it's companion package METplus Wrappers. MET is a suite of
verification tools developed and supported to community via the
Developmental Testbed Center (DTC) for use by the numerical weather
prediction community. METplus Wrappers are intended to be a suite of
Python wrappers and ancillary scripts to enhance the user's ability to
quickly set-up and run MET. Over the next year, METplus Wrappers
will become the authoritative repository for verification of the Unified
Forecast System.

It is important to note here that METplus Wrappers is an evolving
software package. The first release of METplus Wrappers have occurred
in 2017. This documentation describes the 3.0 release in February 2020.
Intermediate releases may include bug fixes. METplus Wrappers is also be
able to accept new modules contributed by the community. While we are
setting up our community contribution protocol, please send email 
to: `met_help@ucar.edu <mailto:>`__ and inform us of your desired
contribution. We will then determine the
maturity of any new verification method and coordinate the inclusion of
the new module in a future version.

This User's Guide was prepared by the developers of the METplus
Wrappers, including Dan Adriaansen, Minna Win-Gildenmeister, George McCabe, 
Julie Prestopnik, Jim Frimel, John Opatz, John Halley Gotway, 
Tara Jensen, Jonathan Vigh, Mallory Row, Christana Kalb, Hank Fisher,
Lisa Goodrich, Lindsay Blank, and Todd Arbetter.
