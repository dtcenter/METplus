**Foreword: A note to METplus Wrappers users**


This User's Guide is provided as an aid to users of the Model Evaluation
Tools (MET) and it's companion package METplus Wrappers. MET is a suite of
verification tools developed and supported to community via the
Developmental Testbed Center (DTC) for use by the numerical weather
prediction community. METplus Wrappers are intended to be a suite of
Python wrappers and ancillary scripts to enhance the user's ability to
quickly set-up and run MET. Over the next year, METplus Wrappers
will become the authoritative repository for verification of the Unified
Forecast System.

It is important to note here that METplus Wrappers is an evolving
software package. The METplus Wrappers package was first released
in 2017. This documentation describes the |release_info|.
Intermediate releases may include bug fixes. METplus Wrappers is also be
able to accept new modules contributed by the community. While we are
setting up our community contribution protocol, please send email
to: `met_help@ucar.edu <mailto:>`__ and inform us of your desired
contribution. We will then determine the
maturity of any new verification method and coordinate the inclusion of
the new module in a future version.

This User's Guide was prepared by the developers of the METplus
Wrappers, including Dan Adriaansen, Minna Win-Gildenmeister, George McCabe,
Julie Prestopnik, Jim Frimel, John Opatz, John Halley Gotway,
Tara Jensen, Jonathan Vigh, Mallory Row, Christana Kalb, Hank Fisher,
Lisa Goodrich, Lindsay Blank, and Todd Arbetter.

staff at the Developmental Testbed Center for their help, advice,and many types of support.
We released METplus Alpha in February 2017 and would not have made a decade of
cutting-edge verification support without those who participated in DTC planning
workshops and the NGGPS United Forecast System Strategic Implementation Plan Working
Groups (UFS SIP WGs).
