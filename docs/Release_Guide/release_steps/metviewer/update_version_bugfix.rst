Update Version Number for Release
---------------------------------

Update the version number for the bugfix release:

* For METplotpy, the file containing the version number is located at docs/version. 
* If the current release is listed as X.Y.Z (major.minor.micro), the bugfix version should be X.Y.Z+1
  (i.e. increment the micro value by 1: 1.1.0 becomes 1.1.1)
