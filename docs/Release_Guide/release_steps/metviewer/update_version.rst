Update Version Number for Release
---------------------------------

Create the version number

- In the METplotpy/docs/version file, assign the version to the '__version__' keyword
- We are naming releases with X.Y.Z format even if Z is 0.
- In the develop branch, the version should match the upcoming release like X.Y.Z-betaN
