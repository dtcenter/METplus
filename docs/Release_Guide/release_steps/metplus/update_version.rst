Update Version Number for Release
---------------------------------

Remove **-dev** from the version number:

* As of METplus v4.0.0-beta2, we are naming releases with X.Y.Z format even if Z is 0. ( As of METplus v3.0, the file containing the version number is located at docs/version (in earlier releases, the file was located at doc/version)

* In the develop branch, the version should match the upcoming release with -dev added to the end like X.Y.Z-betaN-dev, i.e. 4.0.0-beta1-dev

* Remove **-dev** from the version number so that it matches the release you are creating.

* Commit changes and push to GitHub.
