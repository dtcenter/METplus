Update Version Number for Release
---------------------------------

Update the version number for the bugfix release:

* As of METplus v3.0, the file containing the version number is located at docs/version (in earlier releases, the file was located at doc/version).
* If the current release is listed as X.Y.Z, the bugfix version should be X.Y.Z+1, i.e. if on 3.1.0 change to 3.1.1
