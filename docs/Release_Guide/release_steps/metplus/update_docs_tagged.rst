Update the Documentation on the Web
-----------------------------------

* Refer to the Contributor's Guide for instructions on `how to build the
  documentation <https://dtcenter.github.io/METplus/develop/Contributors_Guide/add_use_case.html#build-the-documentation>`_.
* Build the documentation with the correct conda environment by entering the
  docs directory and running './build_docs.py -release' (-release will update release date file).
* In another directory, checkout the gh-pages branch of repository.
* Create a new directory in the gh-pages branch for the release appending a
  "v" to the front, i.e. vX.Y.Z
* Put all contents of docs/_build/html into the directory.
* Update versions.json to add the new directory name.
* Update symbolic link for 'latest' to point to new version.
* Commit changes and push to GitHub.
* Verify that documentation appears in the pull-down and latest points to the
  new version on the web: dtcenter.github.io/METplus
