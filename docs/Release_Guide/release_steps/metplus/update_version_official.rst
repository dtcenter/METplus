Update Version Number for Release
---------------------------------

Remove **-dev** from the version number:

* As of METplus 4.0.0-beta2, we are naming releases with X.Y.Z format even if Z is 0.
* As of METplus v3.0, the file containing the version number is located at docs/version (in earlier releases, the file was located at doc/version).
* In the develop branch, the version should match the upcoming release with -dev added to the end like X.Y.Z-betaN-dev, i.e. 4.0.0-beta1-dev
* Remove **-dev** from the version number so that it matches the release you are creating.

Update the version number in the quick search links:

* Open the docs/Users_Guide/quicksearch.rst file for editing.
* Replace the word "develop" in all of the links with "vX.Y.Z", replacing the X.Y.Z with the version number.  For example, replace "develop" with "v4.0.0".
* Save and close the file.
