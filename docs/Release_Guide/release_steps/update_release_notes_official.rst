Update Release Notes
--------------------

You can refer to the GitHub Issues page to see what has changed for this
release. Open the following URL in a browser:

.. parsed-literal::

    https://github.com/dtcenter/|projectRepo|/issues

* Click on the Projects tab and select the project (under Repository) that
  corresponds to the release you are creating.

* Update the release-notes.rst file found in the User's Guide directory.

* Consider organizing release notes into logical groups
  (e.g. Enhancements, Bugfixes, Documentation, etc.) and modifying
  GitHub issue titles for consistency. The release notes should match
  the GitHub issue titles, when possible.
  
* Use your best judgement to apply bold formatting for any major or important changes.

* When creating the official release, combine the beta release sections
  into one section (i.e. "Version X.Y.Z release notes (YYYYMMDD)").
  
* Commit changes and push to GitHub.
