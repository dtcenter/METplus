Update the Documentation on the Web
-----------------------------------

Because Read the Docs is configured to automate the building of new "main"
branches in the METplus components' repositories, nothing needs to be done
to build the documentation for the new release. See the
:ref:`Read the Docs section <read-the-docs>` for further information.
For an official release, it is important to update the "Default branch" to
this latest "main" branch.  An administrator of the METplus component
repository will need to do the following to update the default branch:

  * Log into their Read the Docs account
    
  * Click on the appropriate METplus component project
    
  * Click on Admin in the top menu
    
  * Click on Advanced Settings in the left menu
     
  * Select the new default branch in the dropdown menu for "Default branch"
    (e.g. main_v4.0.0)
    
  * Ensure that "latest" points to the new default branch by clicking on
    "View Docs"in the upper right corner and confirm that the version number
    displayed in the header is the desired version for "latest".
