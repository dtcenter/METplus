Set up Reminder to Delete Beta Tags
-----------------------------------

Help keep our GitHub repositories and DockerHub clean by removing beta tags.
Do not delete the beta tags for this release right away.  Please set a
calendar reminder or schedule an email to be sent to yourself two weeks
from the release date to remind yourself to delete the beta tags in both
GitHub and DockerHub (if applicable).
