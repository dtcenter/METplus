Set up Reminder to Delete Beta/RC Tags and Releases
---------------------------------------------------

Help keep the GitHub repositories and DockerHub clean by removing
beta/rc tags and releases.
Do not delete the tags/releases for this release right away.  Please set a
calendar reminder or schedule an email to be sent two weeks from the release
date as a reminder to delete the tags/releases.

In GitHub, first delete all of the releases that contain beta or rc in the name,
then delete all corresponding tags.
Delete any beta/rc tags in DockerHub if applicable.
