Update Version Number for Release
---------------------------------

Remove **-dev** from the version number

- As of METplus v3.0, the file containing the version number is located at docs/version (in earlier releases, the file was located at doc/version)
- In the develop branch, the version should match the upcoming release with -dev added to the end like X.Y-betaN-dev, i.e. 4.0-beta1-dev
- Remove **-dev** from the version number so that it matches the release you are creating
