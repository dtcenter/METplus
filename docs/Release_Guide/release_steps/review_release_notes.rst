Review Release Notes
--------------------

The release notes should have been updated for each development release, so
there may not be any new notes to add. Review the release-notes.rst file
located in the User's Guide directory to ensure all of the text is accurate.
If anything noteworthy has been changed since the release candidate (rc)
was created, be sure to include that as well.
