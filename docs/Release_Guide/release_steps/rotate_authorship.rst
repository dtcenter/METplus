Rotate Authorship
-----------------

The METplus team rotates the list of authors in the citation instructions for each official release:

* Compare the current |projectRepo| User's Guide citation to the most recent official release.

* If needed, update the authorship order, moving the previous first author to the end of the list.

* Review the list of authors in the citation and at the top level of the documentation and update as needed.
