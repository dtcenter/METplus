Rotate Authorship
-----------------

The METplus team rotates the list of authors in the citation instructions
for each official release:

* Compare the current |projectRepo| User's Guide citation to the most recent
  official release.

* If needed, update the authorship order, moving the previous first author to
  the end of the list. Note the format difference in the first name in the
  citation list compared with the others.  The first name in the citation list
  is "Last name, First Initial." and all of the following names as
  "First Initial. Last Name".  Please maintain that format as it is the most
  common format for citations.

* Review the list of authors in the citation and at the top level of the
  documentation and update as needed.
