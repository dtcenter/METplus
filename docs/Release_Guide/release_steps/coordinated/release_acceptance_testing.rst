Release Acceptance Testing
--------------------------

A single GitHub Discussion is created in the METplus repository in the
`Release Acceptance Testing <https://github.com/dtcenter/METplus/discussions/categories/release-acceptance-testing>`_
category to summarize external testing for all development cycles of the METplus
components included in a coordinated release.

* Navigate to the `Release Acceptance Testing <https://github.com/dtcenter/METplus/discussions/categories/release-acceptance-testing>`_
  discussion for this coordinated release.
* Review and finalize any entries still marked as **OPEN** or **FAIL** in the **Status**
  column of the repository testing tables. Ideally, the status for all table entries
  should be **PASS** for a coordinated release.
* Click on the **Close discussion** button at the bottom discussion.
* Do *not* **Lock conversation** on this discussion to allow external testers
  to provide additional comments, as needed.
