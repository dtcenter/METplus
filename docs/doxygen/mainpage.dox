\section the_manual Generating the Website

This manual is a living document based on the version of the
scripts.  It is generated from special comments in the scripts 
themselves by a program called Doxygen, a documentation generation suite.  

Go to the METplus GitHub Pages for information on how to generate this
METplus API website, and a LaTeX version of the same.

<!--###

This manual is a living document.  It is generated from special
comments in the scripts themselves by a program called Doxygen, a
documentation generation suite.  Users can generate the entire
website, and a LaTeX version of the same, if they have **Doxygen version
1.8.9.1 or later**.

\code{.sh}
git clone https://www.github.com/NCAR/METplus
cd METplus/sorc/
make doc
cd ../doc
# copy the entire contents of the html/ directory to a web server
\endcode

As the METplus code is updated, the documentation should
be updated as well, and any public version of this manual should add
the new version.
