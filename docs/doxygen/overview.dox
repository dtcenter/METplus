\section portlay Portability Layer

The Portability Layer is a Python package (see @ref produtil_overview
"produtil") which implements cross-platform methods of doing common
tasks.  For example, it implements a way of running MPI, OpenMP and
serial programs in a cross-platform manner.  It can perform file
operations with improved logging, interact with the batch system,
identify limitations of the cluster, deal with restricted data
classes, manipulate resource limits, and interact with a database
file.  Currently, METplus uses this for logging, configuration files, and
running/executing MET and other commands.
