The Developmental Testbed Center (DTC)
--------------------------------------

METplus Wrappers has been developed, and will be maintained and
enhanced, by the Developmental Testbed Center (DTC;
http://www.dtcenter.org/ ). The main goal of the DTC is to serve as a
bridge between operations and research and to facilitate the activities of
these two important components of the numerical weather prediction (NWP)
community. The DTC provides an environment that is functionally
equivalent to the operational environment in which the research
community can test model enhancements; the operational community
benefits from DTC testing and evaluation of models before new models are
implemented operationally. METplus Wrappers serves both the research and
operational communities in this way - offering capabilities for
researchers to test their own enhancements to models and providing a
capability for the DTC to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of
advances in NWP prior to operational implementation.
