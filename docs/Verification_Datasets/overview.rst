Purpose of the Verification Datasets Guide
------------------------------------------

Replace content below.

The goal of this User's Guide is to equip users with the information
needed to use the Model Evaluation Tools (MET) and its companion
package METplus Wrappers. MET is a set of verification tools developed
and supported to community via the Developmental Testbed Center (DTC)
for use by the numerical weather prediction community. METplus Wrappers
is a suite of Python wrappers and ancillary scripts to enhance the
user's ability to quickly set-up and run MET. Over the next few years,
METplus Wrappers will become the authoritative repository for
verification of the Unified Forecast System.

The METplus Wrappers User's Guide is organized as follows. An overview of METplus
Wrappers can be found below. :ref:`install` contains basic information about how to get started with METplus
Wrappers - including system requirements, required software, and how to
download METplus Wrappers. :ref:`sysconf` provides
information about configuring your environment and METplus Wrappers
installation.

The Developmental Testbed Center (DTC)
--------------------------------------

METplus Wrappers has been developed, and will be maintained and
enhanced, by the Developmental Testbed Center (DTC;
http://www.dtcenter.org/ ). The main goal of the DTC is to serve as a
bridge between operations and research and to facilitate the activities of
these two important components of the numerical weather prediction (NWP)
community. The DTC provides an environment that is functionally
equivalent to the operational environment in which the research
community can test model enhancements; the operational community
benefits from DTC testing and evaluation of models before new models are
implemented operationally. METplus Wrappers serves both the research and
operational communities in this way - offering capabilities for
researchers to test their own enhancements to models and providing a
capability for the DTC to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of
advances in NWP prior to operational implementation.
