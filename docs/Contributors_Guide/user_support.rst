User Support

Support for the METplus components is provided through the
`METplus GitHub Discussions Forum <https://github.com/dtcenter/METplus/discussions>`_.
Discussions is a collaborative communication forum, where the METplus
community can ask and answer questions, gather feedback, and share tips and
tricks. Discussions are categorized to help community members find related
discussions and begin conversations in the right place. 


Support Responsibilities
========================

Five staff members take turns monitoring Discussions each day of the week.


Review the Tips/Tricks Page
---------------------------

Review the `Tips/Tricks <https://github.com/dtcenter/METplus/discussions/categories/tips-tricks>`_
page.

Check for any new dicussions that have been added by users that are actually
questions. If there are, move the discussion to a more approprate category so
that it can be found when filtering for unanswered discussions.  Please note
that if the discussions have been filtered by "Unanswered" and the Tips/Tricks
category is selected, no results will be found because these discussions are not
answerable.

If a new tip or trick has been added, please review the addition.  Consider
adding any comments to add detail or clarify, and thank the user for their
contribution.

Review the Unanswered Discussions
---------------------------------

Review the `unanswered discussions <https://github.com/dtcenter/METplus/discussions?discussions_q=is%3Aunanswered>`_.

* For new discussions that have been posted within 24 hours:

  * If the issue is time sensitive, i.e. related to an upcoming training series
    session, take action.  See :ref:`actions_new_discussions`.

  * Otherwise, leave the discussion unanswered until the next day to allow the
    user community time to respond.

* For new discussions that have 0 repsonses and were posted the previous day:

  * Take action. See :ref:`actions_new_discussions`.

* Remaining unanswered discussions:

  * Review the latest on discussion history to see if any additional action is
    required.

    * If an obvious answer exists, consider marking it as the answer and
      locking the discussion to prevent future posts.

    * If the user has not responded in 7 or more days, consider following up to
      see if the user's issue is resolved or if they need more assistance.

    * If unsure how to proceed, post in the User Support Slack channel of
      dtc-metplus.slack.com tagging the person who has been assisting the user.

Review Answered Discussions that are Unlocked
---------------------------------------------

Review `anwered discussions that are unlocked <https://github.com/dtcenter/METplus/discussions?discussions_q=is%3Aanswered+is%3Aunlocked>`_.

Actions for Handling New Discussions
------------------------------------

* Check to see if the discussion should be reassigned from its current category
  to some other category.

* Review the labels and pick at least one of the blue ones (component: and/or
  repository-specific) to further categorize it.

* Ensure the discussion is answered:

  * If you can answer it yourself, do so.

  * If you can answer it with help from someone, post to the User Support Slack
    channel of dtc-metplus.slack.com, asking for advice.

  * If it would be better to have someone else answer, coordinate in the User
    Support Slack channel of dtc-metplus.slack.com or comment on the discussion
    with something like::
      
      @<fill in username> would be the best person to address your question.
      He should respond within a couple of days.

    If it is obvious that we also need to test data, please ask the user to
    send that data, pointing them to the
    `How to Send Us Data <https://github.com/dtcenter/METplus/discussions/954>`_
    discussions post.
