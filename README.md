Welcome to the METplus GitHub repository hosted to the community through
the Developmental Testbed Center (DTC).

METplus is a Python scripting infrastructure around the MET verification tools
(and eventually METViewer, a tool used for plotting MET output verification statistics).

Documentation for both Users and Contributors can be found [here](https://metplus.readthedocs.io).
For more information about the entire suite of tools, please visit the
[DTC METplus website](https://dtcenter.org/community-code/metplus).

Support for the METplus components is provided through the
[METplus Discussions](https://github.com/dtcenter/METplus/discussions) forum.
Users are welcome and encouraged to answer or address each other's questions there!  For more
information, please read
"[Welcome to the METplus Components Discussions](https://github.com/dtcenter/METplus/discussions/939)".

This infrastructure utilizes the NCEP produtil package, which is a platform-independent
weather and ocean forecasting utility package developed at the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
