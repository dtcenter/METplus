Welcome to the METplus GitHub repository hosted to the community through
the Developmental Testbed Center (DTC).

METplus is a Python scripting infrastructure around the MET verification tools
(and eventually METViewer, a tool used for plotting MET output verification statistics).

Documentation for both Users and Contributors can be found here: https://metplus.readthedocs.io
For more information about the entire suite of tools, please visit the MET website
(https://dtcenter.org/community-code/model-evaluation-tools-met) and direct questions
to met_help@ucar.edu.

This infrastructure utilizes the NCEP produtil package, which is a platform-independent
weather and ocean forecasting utility package developed at the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
