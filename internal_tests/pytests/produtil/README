The test_produtil.py provides some simple tests for the produtil module.

To run the test:

1) cd to the directory METplus/internal_tests/pytest/produtil

2) open the test_produtil.py file and replace the '/path/to' with the full path to the directory where your produtil_test.conf file
resides (this will be in METplus/internal_tests/pytest/produtil).

NOTE: This is necessary, as we are NOT using run_metplus.py to begin the process of reading in the config
file, test_produtil.conf


2) Then, from the command line, enter the following command:

    pytest -c ./produtil_test.conf

There are currently 9 tests and they should pass.
